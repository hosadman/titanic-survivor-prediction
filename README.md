# Titanic Survivor Prediction

## Introduction
Predicting the survival chances of passengers in the Titanic disaster.

## Libraries Used
The main program is written in Python. We've used Pandas and NumPy libraries 
of Python for data analysis. For prediction, we've used the machine learning
libraries of Python like Scikit. Also, for visual representations, we've used
MatPlotlib and Seaborn.

## Files Included
Different categories of data of the passengers on board are given in the
csv file. The ipynb file includes the python code for the analysis of the
data and the prediction of the survival chances using various machine learning
models.
